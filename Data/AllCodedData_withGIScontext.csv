Habitat: low alpine zone, where snow cover remains until late June and the main vegetation types are grass and herbaceous dicotyledon meadows, Empetrum- and Vaccinium dominated heaths and Eriophorum and Carex marshes. soil and top layer samples were collected in the field, but then placed in phytotron chambers for germination. Sometimes seedlings died before ID, so were classified into dicotyledon, graminoid, ericoid shrub, or 'plant'. Seed densities are sometimes reported by growth form (i.e. groups of species), but other times broken down into seed mass or diaspore morphology.","Marcus Spiegel","Isabel C Barrio",-3,61,26,5871,120,-112,232,74,-56,76,-71,544,66,30,25,188,101,177,113,-73.7519960067037,0.202898550724638,0.415058223124856,0.878117379795464,2.12330236471888,5.01469890043891,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.11526217907079,29.314023,70.42795,TRUE

Detailed habitat description: The study was conducted on a mountain slope (150 m transect) including several habitats from a more sheltered lower slope just below timberline to a more wind-blown upper slope supporting treeless mountain heath vegetation. From the article: In the lower slope, the field layer vegetation consisted mainly of dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub type heath mixed with Empetrum–Lichenes type heaths. In this area, B. nana and S. glauca are c. 40–60 cm tall and Vaccinium myrtillus and mosses in the ground layer are still fairly abundant. On the middle slope, Empetrum heaths dominate with more lichen-rich ground layer. The height of B. nana is c. 20–30 cm and V. myrtillusis missing. In the upper part, the shrub layer is scarce and the vegetation represents mainly lichen-rich Empetrum heaths mixed with wind-swept Arctostaphylos–Alectoria and Empetrum–Loiseleuria type heaths (Oksanen & Virtanen, 1995).","Isabel C Barrio","Isabel C Barrio",-27,76,23,8569,146,-181,327,89,-90,89,-132,483,74,23,34,177,75,177,111,-254.460043379165,0.213814742406229,0.414977606767862,0.881000619057153,0.387874351242396,1.01396999339497,83.2380038904982,118.979736536123,0.112469158891816,0.0335569604409319,1.1728071652031,20.95,68.91666667,TRUE
