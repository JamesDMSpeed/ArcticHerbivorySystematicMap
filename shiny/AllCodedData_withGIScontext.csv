From the article: In the lower slope, the field layer vegetation consisted mainly of dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub type heath mixed with EmpetrumâLichenes type heaths. In this area, B. nana and S. glauca are c. 40â60 cm tall and Vaccinium myrtillus and mosses in the ground layer are still fairly abundant. On the middle slope, Empetrum heaths dominate with more lichen-rich ground layer. The height of B. nana is c. 20â30 cm and V. myrtillusis missing. In the upper part, the shrub layer is scarce and the vegetation represents mainly lichen-rich Empetrum heaths mixed with wind-swept ArctostaphylosâAlectoria and EmpetrumâLoiseleuria type heaths (Oksanen & Virtanen, 1995).","Isabel C Barrio","Isabel C Barrio","Vertebrate",-27,76,23,8569,146,-181,327,89,89,-132,483,74,23,34,177,75,177,111,"Subarctic",NA,0.213814742406229,0.414977606767862,0.881000619057153,0.387874351242396,1.01396999361111,83.2380038904982,118.979736536123,0.112469158891816,0.0335569604409319,1.16372581607662,20.95,68.91666667,TRUE
