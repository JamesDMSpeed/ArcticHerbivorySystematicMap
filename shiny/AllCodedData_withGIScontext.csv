From the article: In the lower slope, the field layer vegetation consisted mainly of dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub type heath mixed with Empetrum‚ÄìLichenes type heaths. In this area, B. nana and S. glauca are c. 40‚Äì60 cm tall and Vaccinium myrtillus and mosses in the ground layer are still fairly abundant. On the middle slope, Empetrum heaths dominate with more lichen-rich ground layer. The height of B. nana is c. 20‚Äì30 cm and V. myrtillusis missing. In the upper part, the shrub layer is scarce and the vegetation represents mainly lichen-rich Empetrum heaths mixed with wind-swept Arctostaphylos‚ÄìAlectoria and Empetrum‚ÄìLoiseleuria type heaths (Oksanen & Virtanen, 1995).","Isabel C Barrio","Isabel C Barrio","Vertebrate",-27,76,23,8569,146,-181,327,89,89,-132,483,74,23,34,177,75,177,111,"Subarctic",NA,0.213814742406229,0.414977606767862,0.881000619057153,0.387874351242396,1.01396999361111,83.2380038904982,118.979736536123,0.112469158891816,0.0335569604409319,1.16372581607662,20.95,68.91666667,TRUE
